  - Assumptions & Simplifications
- Discretization & Mapping
  - Geometry
  - Structure
  - Special Requirements (Wall functions, etc.)
- Transport on Grids
  - Challenges
  - Strategies
- Grid Data Structures
  - Representations
  - Distributed Computing
- Matrix Solvers & Conditioning
- Shock Modeling
- Software Quality/V&V
- Chemistry Modeling in Flows
  - Combustion Chemistry
  - Reaction Coordinate Method

Some material draws from my 2016 course ME 498CF “Computational Fluid Dynamics with Fluent”.
