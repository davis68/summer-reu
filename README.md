# CEESD Summer REU Tutorials

These tutorials were prepared by N E Davis for the [Center for Exascale-Enabled Scramjet Design](https://ceesd.illinois.edu/).  The program's design was inspired by the [Los Alamos National Laboratory Computational Physics Student Summer Workshop](https://www.lanl.gov/org/padwp/adx/computational-physics/summer-workshop/index.php).

0. [The Physics of Scramjets](./0-physics.md)
  - Qualitative Behavior
  - Governing Equations
  - Physical Models
  - Assumptions & Simplifications
1. [Discretization & Mapping](./1-discrete.md)
  - Geometry
  - Structure
  - Special Requirements (Wall functions, etc.)
2. [Grid Data Structures](./2-griddata.md)
  - Representations
  - Distributed Computing
3. [Transport on Grids](./3-transport.md)
4. [Matrix Solvers & Conditioning](./4-solvers.md)
5. [Shock Modeling](./5-shocks.md)
6. [Software Quality/V&V](./6-verval.md)
7. [Chemistry Modeling in Flows](./7-chemrxn.md)
  - Combustion Chemistry
